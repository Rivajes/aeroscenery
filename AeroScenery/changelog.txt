0.6

- GeoConvert no longer runs if the user stops the generation process
- Open Map toolbar item now uses decimal point irrespective of system culture
- Map toolbar items are not enabled if a grid square is not selected
- FSCloudPort airport coordinates are parsed with a decimal point irrespective of system culture
- Custom message box form for catch all exception handling
- Airport markers are now shown correctly when "Show Airports" is pressed if the map has not been moved
- Database, wokring and SDK folders are now checked for existence on app start
- UI is locked while tasks are running to prevent collection modified exceptions
- Recreate raw and ttc folders before running GeoConvert
- Fixed issue with image tile stitcher where image was cropped to the wrong width
- Option to shrink grid square coordinates in the TMC file by specified value. Defaults to 0.01. This forces GeoConvert to snap "outwards" to the nearest edge​
- AID files use exponential notation
- TMC files use more accurate coordinates
